# HS_PNP
The Hard Sphere Poisson-Nernst-Planck (HSPNP) system is a mathematical model that describes ion behavior in an electrolyte solution confined to a region with hard spherical obstacles. It combines the Poisson equation for electrostatic potential with the Nernst-Planck equations for ion diffusion and drift due to gradients and electric fields.
